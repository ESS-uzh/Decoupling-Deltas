Delta_ES.shp
Shapefile containing delineations of the 235 deltas analysed in the paper. These were produced by the authors by manually delineating large deltas around the watershed surrounding their distributary network (see paper for details on their production). Coordinate reference system ESPG:3857 – WGS 84.


Delta_ES_results
Excel spreadsheet containing the processed ecosystem service and modification indicator data for each delta, along with delta descriptions, the combined bundle data, the decoupling of each delta per ecosystem service and modification indicator, and the binning of each delta per modification indicator (see meta tab for more detail).


Cluster_ensemble
R code to cluster the ecosystem services across the deltas.

DES.csv
Input data to cluster


Cluster_relabel
MATLAB code to relabel the results of the clustering algorithms consistently.

DEScluster.xlsx
Input data to relabel. This represents the clustering results of the ensemble.
